# This playbook updates the apt package cache and upgrades all installed packages
# to their latest versions on target hosts using the ansible.builtin.apt module.

# This playbook requires the target hosts to be running a Debian-based distribution
# (like Ubuntu or Debian) where the apt package manager is used.

    - name: Update apt cache and upgrade packages safely # Name describing this specific task's action
      ansible.builtin.apt: # Use the 'apt' module from the 'ansible.builtin' collection.
                           # This module is specifically designed for managing packages
                           # on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
        update_cache: yes # Parameter to run 'apt update' on the target host.
                          # This downloads the latest package information from the repositories,
                          # ensuring that Ansible knows about the newest available package versions.
        upgrade: yes # Parameter to perform a standard package upgrade ('apt upgrade').
                     # This upgrades all packages that have a newer version available,
                     # without removing existing packages or installing new ones
                     # unless strictly required for dependencies of packages being upgraded.
                     # Using 'dist' here would perform a distribution upgrade ('apt full-upgrade').

        # The 'msg' parameter defines the message to display.
        # '{{ inventory_hostname }}' is an Ansible magic variable showing the current host being processed.
        # '{{ ansible_distribution }}' is a fact gathered by Ansible reporting the OS distribution (e.g., "Debian", "Ubuntu").
        # '{{ ansible_distribution_version }}' is a fact reporting the version of the distribution.
